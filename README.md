✨ Overview

This is a Simple Calculator built with beginner-friendly code. It supports:

➕ Addition

➖ Subtraction

✖️ Multiplication

➗ Division

🔤 Joining (concatenating) text

The calculator is intentionally kept simple so that students, educators, and beginners in programming can easily understand, modify, and use it.

🚀 Features

Basic Math Operations – Perform quick calculations for everyday use.

Text Joining – Combine words or phrases, making it useful for learning language basics.

User-Friendly Design – Straightforward and accessible for learners at different levels.

Expandable – Can be extended with more operations as learners grow.

🎯 Why This Matters for SDG 4 (Quality Education)

SDG 4 aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.

This calculator contributes by:

📚 Supporting digital literacy – Helps children and beginners practice both math and text operations interactively.

🧮 Making learning hands-on – Encourages problem-solving by experimenting with numbers and words.

🌍 Reducing barriers to education – Provides a free, open-source learning tool that can be used in classrooms or self-learning contexts.

👩🏾‍🏫 Enhancing teacher support – Teachers can use it as a demo tool when teaching basic arithmetic or string concepts.

By combining math and text, the calculator bridges numeracy and literacy, which are the foundation blocks of early education.

🛠️ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository
